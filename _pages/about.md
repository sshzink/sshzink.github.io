## About
I’ve always had a knack for language. In 2021, I graduated from Hunter College with a B.A. in Foreign Language and Literature (French, Spanish, and Japanese), which felt like the perfect way to dig into language and culture the way I always intended. Connecting across cultures was something that was very important to me, and so I was naturally drawn to these concepts and excited for my future of linguistic connections.

Growing up, I was your average computer nerd. I spent hours messing around with tech and figuring out how everything worked. It just didn't occur to me at that age that I could take that curiosity and turn it into something academic, let alone a career. After undergrad, I kept coming back to this idea: what if I could combine those two parts of myself? A few years later, I decided to stop wondering and actually do it. That’s when I took the leap and went back to school for an M.S. in Human Language Technology at the University of Arizona.

## Why NLP
Making that shift completely changed the way I look at language. Instead of just studying it, I was now starting to build things with it. Over the past two years, I’ve worked on combining my linguistics background with newfound computational skills to tackle diverse projects of varied topics, including sentiment analysis, document classification, chatbot development, and speech technology (with specific projects in speech recognition and TTS for foreign language). Throughout the program, I developed my coding skills in Python, all while learning about the fundamental NLP tools. This allowed me to dive deep into the statistical backbone of modern NLP, dealing with things like n-gram models, information retrieval, and smoothing techniques. I also explored powerful probabilistic models such as Hidden Markov Models and applied advanced algorithms to complex language tasks. This helped me approach problems in a way that turns simple concepts into practical, usable tools. What I’ve enjoyed most is coming to fully understand how prevalent the influence of this field actually is on the world we live in.

## What’s Next
Now that I have worked on my technical skills, I'm most excited about the concept of using these skills to bring people together. Whether it’s making tools that help language learners feel more confident, creating better accessibility for under‑resourced communities, or building systems that actually feel intuitive to use, I’m motivated by the idea of technology that makes communication easier. And it doesn't hurt that I'm driven by the intellectual challenge.

Ultimately, my path has been about bringing these two foundational passions, language and technology, together. Moving forward, I am dedicated to a career that continually blends linguistics and computer science, not only to create tools that break down barriers and help people connect, but also to contribute to the fundamental advancements that push the field of NLP forward.

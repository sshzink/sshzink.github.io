My academic journey has been rooted in a lifelong passion for language and culture. In 2021, I earned my B.A. in French Language and Literature and Japanese Language from Hunter College. Initially focused on deepening my understanding of linguistic theory and cross-cultural communication, I soon found myself drawn to the ways technology can expand and enhance those same human connections. That curiosity led me to pivot from a purely humanities-driven background into the world of computational linguistics, and ultimately to pursue my M.S. in Human Language Technology (HLT) at the University of Arizona.

Over the course of this two‑year program, I’ve built a strong foundation in NLP by combining linguistic knowledge with practical computational skills. My studies have spanned the core pillars of NLP, as well as applied techniques like document classification, sentiment analysis, translation tools, and chatbot design. I’ve explored both rule‑based and statistical approaches, working with tools like spaCy, NLTK, and CoreNLP, and gained exposure to neural network architectures. Coursework and projects have also introduced me to speech technology, including automatic speech recognition and TTS systems, and the algorithms behind them. Beyond implementation, I’ve learned to evaluate these models, considering performance trade‑offs, bias, and real‑world usability.

My coding experience has grown alongside this technical knowledge. I’ve developed Python‑based pipelines for text analysis, implemented probabilistic models like n‑gram language models and Hidden Markov Models, and experimented with finite‑state methods and context‑free grammars for parsing tasks. I’ve also dabbled in Prolog for rule‑driven grammars and SQL for managing and querying linguistic datasets. Through these projects, I’ve learned to bridge theory and practice — not only understanding how these algorithms work, but applying them to real‑world use cases like grammar checking, language‑learning chatbots, and semantic similarity evaluation.

What excites me most about this field is its human impact. Whether it’s improving accessibility for under-resourced communities, building more intuitive tools for language learners, or creating systems that better understand users’ needs, I’m motivated by the opportunity to make technology feel approachable and meaningful. As I near the completion of my M.S., I’m eager to continue blending linguistics and computer science to develop NLP solutions that break down barriers and bring people closer together.

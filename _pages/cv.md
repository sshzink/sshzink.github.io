## Education  
**MS Human Language Technology – University of Arizona (2023–2025)**  
I am currently completing my Master’s in Human Language Technology with a focus on Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics. The program has given me the chance to build a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied linguistics alongside machine learning and programming coursework.  

**BA French Language & Civilization – CUNY Hunter College (2017–2021)**  
As an undergraduate, I concentrated in French with focused study in Japanese. I had the opportunity to study abroad at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne in 2019, an experience that deepened my appreciation for multilingualism and language acquisition. I also served as President of the Queer Student Union from 2019–2021, developing leadership and organizational skills that I continue to carry into my work today.  

## Projects  
**Multilingual Translator Tool** – A hybrid rule-based and statistical translator for English, Spanish, and French.  
**Author Identification System** – A multi-branch neural model that integrates deep learning with handcrafted stylometric features to determine shared authorship between text samples.  
**Spanish-Learning Chatbot** – A browser-based language-learning chatbot designed for English speakers learning Spanish. Features include:  
  - Structured lessons (multiple-choice + free-response)  
  - CSV-driven vocabulary expansion  
  - Conjugation/grammar feedback  
  - Spanglish-based reinforcement for early learners

## Skills  
- **Programming:** Python, Java, R, Prolog, SQL, Perl  
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn  
- **NLP Tools:** NLTK, SpaCy, Stanford CoreNLP, Gensim  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tableau  
- **Other Tools:** GitHub, Docker, Google Cloud  

## Work Experience   
Before transitioning into NLP, I built a strong foundation in team management and operations across multiple industries:  
- **Pet Care – Austin Pet Ranch (2022–Current)**  
  Manage daily operations for a large-scale boarding and training facility, overseeing the care of up to 160 animals and leading a team of 10 employees.  
- **Food & Beverage – Starbucks (2016–2022)**  
  Progressed from Barista to Shift Supervisor and ultimately General Manager, leading teams of 20+ in high-volume café environments. Directed staff training and development, streamlined operations, and implemented strategies to enhance customer experience.
